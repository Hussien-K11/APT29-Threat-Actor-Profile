# APT29 Threat Actor Profile

## 1. Project Overview

This project presents a professional-grade threat actor profile on **APT29 (aka Cozy Bear)**, designed to simulate the output of a junior SOC analyst within a real-world cybersecurity team.

The objective is to demonstrate threat intelligence skills by:
- Researching a state-sponsored threat group
- Mapping their known tactics and behaviours
- Summarising real-world campaigns
- Providing actionable recommendations
- Aligning findings with the MITRE ATT&CK framework

This report could serve as:
- An internal threat brief for SOC onboarding
- Contextual support for detection rule development
- A learning resource for junior analysts

APT29 is a high-profile adversary known for stealthy, persistent, and intelligence-driven campaigns â€” understanding their methods helps strengthen proactive defences.
